Graphviz Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a plugin for ``sphinx`` called ``sphinx.ext.graphviz`` which adds support for embedding ``graphviz`` graphs
in your documents. One can achieve this by following these instructions:

#. Make sure ``graphviz`` is properly installed on your machine/environment, for instance it can be installed via ``conda`` like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install -c conda-forge graphviz

#. Make sure that this plugin would be recognized in your ``conf.py`` by adding it to the ``extentions`` list

   .. note::

      In this project the ``conf.py`` is generated by ``cmake`` from the ``conf.py.in`` file and therefore
      this addition should be added to ``conf.py.in`` since it's the template file for the generated ``conf.py``.


   .. code-block:: python

      extentions = [
          ...
          "sphinx.ext.graphviz",
          ...
      ]

After those instructions you should be able to add the following directives in your ``.rst`` files

.. code-block:: rst

   .. graphviz::

      digraph foo {
         "bar" -> "baz";
      }


Here is how it looks:

.. graphviz::

   digraph foo {
      "bar" -> "baz";
   }
