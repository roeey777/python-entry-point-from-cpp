Tools
=====

There are multiple tools used by this project, let's try to list them all (and probably failed):

#. ``CMake`` - The build-system itself.
#. ``Doxygen`` - Documentation generator tool for C/C++ based projects.
#. ``Sphinx`` - Documentation generator tool.
#. ``breathe`` - a ``sphinx`` extension for combining ``sphinx`` with ``doxygen``.
#. ``CppUTest`` - a unit-testing framework for C++ code.
#. :ref:`cppcheck <cppcheck>` - static analyzer tool for C/C++ code.
#. :ref:`clang-tidy <clang-tidy>` - ``clang-tidy`` is a ``clang``-based ``C++`` “linter” tool. Its purpose is to provide an extensible framework for diagnosing and fixing typical programming errors, like style violations, interface misuse, or bugs that can be deduced via static analysis. ``clang-tidy`` is modular and provides a convenient interface for writing new checks.
#. :ref:`include-what-you-use <iwyu>` - A tool for use with clang to analyze #includes in C and C++ source files.
#. :ref:`shfmt <shfmt>` - bash scripts formatter.
#. :ref:`shellcheck <shellcheck>` - static analyzer for bash scripts.
#. :ref:`clang-format <clang-format>` - a ``clang``-based code formatter.
#. ``PlantUML`` - Tool for generating images from UML text.
#. ``Graphviz`` - Tool for generating images from graphviz text.
